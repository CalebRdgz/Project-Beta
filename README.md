Three forms need to be created for Sales Microservice. The sales person form will include a name and an employee number. They will be allowed to set a sold status/move cars in the inviintory to a seperate list, stopping it from being sold/seen in the inventory. Potential customer form will include a name, their address, and a phone number. They will be attached to the sold status/list of a vehicle if they purchase it. Lastly, a sale record form will be added allowing a sales person to mark a car as sold/in the sold list. It will also have mandetory feilds for customer and sales person as well as a recorded price which will be stored in app. These three forms will have Nav Bar links that will be part of the SPA.
